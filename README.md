## Password-locker

This repository contains code for a basic password locker.

## By Margaret Ngethe.

## Description
This is an application that will help us manage our passwords and even generate new passwords for us.

## Behaviour Driven Development
Behavior Driven Development is a way of constructing both non-functional and functional requirements. These requirements are directly converted into code and boosts testing.

## Feature
As a User I want to

As a user, I want to create a password locker account with my details, a login username and password.
As a user, I want to store my already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming I already have a twitter account, I want to store my already existing twitter username and password in the application.
As a user, I want to create new account credentials in the application. For example, if I have not yet signed up for Instagram, I would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when I sign up for Instagram.
As a user, I want to have the option of putting in a password that I want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating my Instagram credential account, I want to have an option of putting in the password I want to use instead of having the application generate a password for me.
As a user, I also want to view my various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
As a user, I want to delete a credentials account that I no longer need in the application.
